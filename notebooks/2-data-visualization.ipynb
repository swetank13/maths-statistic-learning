    "### 2.1: Types of Data\n",
    "- Structured data is organized, follows a clear format, and is easy to work with (Ex: Table data, JSON, XML).\n",
    "- Unstructured data lacks a specific structure, is more diverse in content, and requires specialized tools and techniques for analysis (Ex: Audio, Video, Free Form Text).\n",
    "- Categorical data represents categories, labels, or distinct groups. It is used to classify and categorize items or observations based on certain characteristics or attributes.\n",
    "- Numeric data consists of numerical values that represent measurable quantities or continuous variables.\n",
    "- Nominal data consists of categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "- Ordinal data, unlike nominal data, has a specific order or ranking among categories.\n",
    "- Continuous data encompasses an infinite range of precise values, often with decimals.\n",
    "- Discrete data, on the other hand, comprises distinct, countable numerical values."

    "- Use aÂ Horizontal bar chart instead of a pie chart when the number of categories is more than 5.\n",
    "- Use a vertical bar chart (Column chart) for time series data.\n",
    "- Consider a Clustered Column chart for comparing multiple data series within distinct categories."

    "- A stacked column chart is used to represent and compare multiple categories in a single bar, while also displaying the overall total."

    "  3. Identifying trend (ex: linear regression).\n",
    "- A bubble plot (or bubble chart) is used primarily in scenarios where you want to visualize relationships among three or more numeric variables in a single chart. It extends a scatter plot by adding a third dimension through the size of the bubbles (and sometimes a fourth dimension through color).\n",
    "- A bubble plot is best suited for exploring and communicating multivariate data relationships visually, where size and position convey important insights about three variables simultaneously."
