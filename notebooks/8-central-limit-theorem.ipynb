    "- Sample bias occurs when a sample is not representative of the population.\n",
    "- Trial participants should be representative of the population.\n",
    "- Participation bias occurs when the individuals who choose to participate in a study differ significantly from those who do not.\n",
    "- Language bias is the influence of language on perception and decision-making, often leading to skewed interpretations or conclusions.\n",
    "- Survivorship bias happens when we only look at the success stories and ignore the failures, leading to a misleading view of reality."

    "- The central Limit Theorem states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the population's original distribution.\n",
    "- A sample distribution is the distribution calculated from multiple samples of a population.\n",
    "- For sample sizes of 30 or more, sample means and proportions tend to follow a nearly normal distribution.\n",
    "- Population distribution means how a particular characteristic or variable is spread out among all the people or units in a population."
